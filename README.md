# MachineLearning_FruitsProject
Under Dr. Dong Si, researched the effects of image color balance on MachineVision and ML model accuracy using python's machine vision library to train a model that can identify fruits and study the effects that color casts that mimic different lighting throughout the day, have on machine learning models.
• Machine Learning: Engineered model using Tensorflows’ Keras deep learning API to identify object classes at 97% success rate.
• Computer Vision: Implemented Pythons Computer Vision library to generate delimited pixel files to modularize proceeding tasks.
• Data Processing: Simulated various lighting conditions through data set pixel manipulation using Adobe software.
• Training Bias Reduction: Configured the randomization of delimited data using SciKit library reducing training bias & improving accuracy by over 30%.
• Testing Configuration: Developed flexible testing algorithm using Google Colab to accelerate iterations.
• Refined Model Accuracy: Successfully proved initial hypothesis and identified an 11% increase in model accuracy using Matplotlib library
